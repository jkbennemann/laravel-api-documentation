# Example .gitignore for .schemas directory
#
# Copy this file to your project root as part of your main .gitignore
# or place it in the .schemas/ directory as .gitignore
#
# IMPORTANT: DO commit captured response schemas!
# They represent your API's "ground truth" and should be version controlled.

# Option 1: Commit everything in .schemas (RECOMMENDED)
# (No rules needed - just commit the directory)

# Option 2: Commit only response captures, ignore temp files
# .schemas/temp/
# .schemas/cache/

# DO NOT ignore these:
# !.schemas/responses/*.json  ‚Üê These are your captured API responses!
